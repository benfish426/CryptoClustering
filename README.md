# CryptoClustering

For this assignment, we are supposed to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

There are a bunch of different steps we must complete in order to make appropriate predictions. Among them are:
    * Preparing the Data
    * Finding the Best Value for K Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
    * Cluster Cryptocurrencies with the K-Means Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
    * Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    * Finding the Best Value of K Using the PCA Data
    * Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the PCA Data
    * Visualize and Compare the Results
